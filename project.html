    <h1>Downstream</h1>

    <h3>Overview</h3>

    <p>My project concept is an app called ‘Downstream’. My app allows a user to collate and access all of their separate
streaming accounts from a single platform. While the app would not be able to host all of the separate platforms’
different shows and movies on the same page due to legal reasons, it would act in a similar manner to the Wallet
app on iPhone where you can easily select what service you wish to access at any given time and then would open
the desired streaming service within the application for easy access.</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>

<p>Today there are dozens of streaming services that all offer their own unique viewing experiences, from the vast
array of titles on platforms such as Netflix or Disney+,to more niche services such as Crunchyroll or Shudder. It is
exceeding common for the average household to have multiple streaming subscriptions. I myself utilise nine
separate streaming platforms and at times struggle to locate which of my services are currently offering the tv show
or movie that I want to watch. More frustratingly, platforms regularly rotate their available content in accordance
with licensing agreements, so shows that were once accessible on one service may have been removed and picked
up by another, and this makes for a frustrating user experience. Downstream would seek to remedy this problem
and accommodate the fast-growing number of streaming platforms by compiling all of a user’s subscriptions in one
place.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The primary goal of Downstream is to provide an easy to navigate service that makes it simple for users to locate
their desired media quickly. After the initial login page, Downstream will feature four pages within the app for the
user to navigate through via a small footer at the bottom of the screen with simple explanative icons.The first page
will be ‘Library’, this page will show the user their available streaming hosts in a minimalistic easy to navigate list.
The ‘Library’ page will also include a tab for adding additional streaming platforms. Selecting the ‘Add’ button would
give users a comprehensive list of streaming hosts and give them the option of selecting their owned services and
logging in within a popup window directed to the corresponding streaming host. Upon successfully logging in to the
selected third-party streaming host through the popup, the service would be added to the user’s personal
Downstream library.The ‘Library’ page will also feature a search function allowing users to quickly search for titles
of specific shows or movies and will be provided with relevant results detailing which service hosts the media,
whether it is in the user’s current library and will offer the user a button that will direct them into the corresponding
streaming host and to their media. In the case that the user does not have the service in their library, they will be
offered to add the relevant host to their existing library. The second page will be the ‘My Lists’ page and will offer
users the option of adding media to a list as a reminder for future viewing. The third page will be the ‘Recently
Added’ page and will offer a regularly updated list of notifications of titles that have been recently added to hosting
services already within the user’s library. The fourth and final page will be the ‘Settings’ page and will offer the user
options for account configuration and management, help and contact information for troubleshooting and general
app settings. The initial screen will feature a login When first opening the application users will be prompted to
create a new account or sign in to an existing one. Due to legal licensing reasons, Downstream will not host any of
the content from the included third-party streaming hosts and will simply act as a directory and will bridge the gap
between all third-party streaming platforms and will redirect users to their desired content hosted on the external
streaming services.</p>

<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>

<p>To create Downstream, I will be using Xcode, Apple’s integrated development environment (IDE). Xcode is used
to develop software for macOS, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS. I will be using the Swift programming language
to write the programming for Downstream. Swift is a general-purpose, compiled programming language developed
by Apple. Finally,I will be using SwiftUI as the framework for building the application. The useful thing about Xcode,
Swift and SwiftUI is that they are essentially the same tools used to create software for all of Apple’s platforms and
make iOS app development simple than other options. I will also need access to an iPhone for native testing as
well as a computer for the app’s development.</p>

<h3>Skills Required</h3>

<p>I will need to be able to write code utilising Swift, a programming language I am currently unfamiliar with. But
fortunately, due to Swift’s popularity and common use in app development there is an abundance of resources
online to teach beginners how to create their first application using Swift. I will also need to design an attractive
and functional user interface that allows for a smooth and enjoyable user experience. This will require a degree of
creativity and planning to ensure a user-friendly interface. In terms of hardware, it does not require a powerful
computer for app development and all of the required software is free. </p>

<h3>Outcome</h3>

<p>The intent behind the creation of Downstream is to bridge the gap between third party streaming platforms and
give users a seamless, easy to navigate app that offers a way to find their desired tv show/movie all in one place.
The best way to gauge Downstream’s success would be through user satisfaction. As a tool Downstream is
designed to be a quality-of-life application that provides a sort of ‘middleman service’ and as such if as a product
Downstream failed to make the users’ viewing experience simpler and more ordered, than Downstream will have
completely failed in it’s intended purpose. As for commercialisation, after release Downstream could potentially
offer discounts on specific streaming platforms through partnerships or offer an upgraded premium version that
removes ads or makes allows for a larger library compared to that of its free counterpart. But the intention of
Downstream as an application is less about profit and more to provide a service and plug a percei ved gap for
consumers, and so while there are future options for commercialisation depending on the app’s popularity, profiting
is not the overall goal for Downstream’s development.</p>
