<h1>Ideal Job</h1>

<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/56344934?type=standout#sol=d03c337e104d3d81898d31e31e197a140ea0981"target=”_blank”>Database Consultants Australia – Software Developer Position</a><br>

<h3>Job Listing Description</h3>

<p>The position posting is for a Software Developer with Data Consultants Australia at their South Wharf office for a
permanent position. The main responsibilities attached to the role software design and development, coding, unit
testing, production of supporting documentation, assisting internal teams with enquiries and support issues as well
as supporting end-users.Astrong appeal of this software developer position is that the employer (DCA) stipulates:</p>

<p>“This is a perfect opportunity for a recent graduate looking to commence their development career within an
establish, market-leading company. Quality training, support and development opportunities will be provided to
accelerate your career path success with our range of modern technologies.”</p>

<p>This indicates to me that there is likely a positive workplace culture within the business with good opportunities for
career progression for younger employees. My reason for thinking this relates to the difficulty in finding job listings
for recent university graduates without previous employment experience, with indicates DCA promotes a
progressive culture. The opportunity for dealing with end-users and clients is also an interesting aspect that appeals
to me as I want to work in an environment that allows for variance in projects and the day-to-day of the job through
human interaction. The position also comes across as a good opportunity for building experience in team projects
and collaboration with other developers.
</p>

<h3>Skills, Qualities and Attritbutes Required for the Role</h3>

</p>

<h3>Personal Skills, Qualities and Attritbutes</h3>

<p>My personal skills in software development are extremely limited due to my recent entrance and interest in pursuing
a career in the industry. I have an extremely basic understanding of simple programming languages such as
Python, CSS and HTML. Regarding relevant computer programming, I do not hold any current qualifications
despite my current enrolment in a Bachelor of Information of Technology at RMIT, though prior to my current course
I completed a year of a Bachelor of Commerce at Deakin University. I do not have any relevant work experience
to this position.
</p>

<h3>Personal Plan to Achieve Ideal Job</h3>

<p>I plan on angling my future electives towards software development as well as cyber security. I have also been
considering transferring to a Bachelor of Computer Science in my second year as it is often considered a desirable
qualification by employers in the industry. Primarily though my main goal is to secure an internship as soon as I
am given the industry to network and establish connections for future opportunities in the industry. Outside of my
plans for my study, I intend to become fluent in all of the essential programming languages over the course of
completing my degree as they are absolutely necessary for my desired career path.
