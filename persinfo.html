    <h1>Personal Information</h1>

    <p>Born in Shepparton, raised in Bendigo, I moved from Bendigo to Melbourne to study a Bachelor of Information
  Technology at RMIT as a mature age student. I previously studied a Bachelor of Commerce at Deakin University,
  with a particular focus on contractual law, though I did not proceed with my second year of the course due to a
  change in career direction. In my personal time I play in amateur esports tournaments with friends for competitive
  first-person shooter games, such as Rainbow Six Siege and Counter Strike: Global Offensive. If I am not spending
  time with friends, working, studying, or gaming, then I am usually at the gym or walking my golden retriever, Henry.</p>

  <h1>Personal Profile</h1>

  <h3>16 Personsalities Test Results</h3>

  <h3>Learning Style Test Results</h3>

  <h3>Big Five Personality Test Results</h3>

  <h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h3>

  <p>Each of my tests indicate that I am an extroverted personality type that learns by doing, rather than listening or
watching. I am classed as a “Tactile Learner” and prefer practical scenarios to theory heavy learning, meaning I
learn best through hands on practice. My Myers-Briggs test indicated that I am a “Turbulent Entertainer” (ESFPT), meaning I am in my element when socialising and entertaining others. My Big Five Personality test showed that
I am an Empathic Idealist, indicating that I am sensitive to others’ emotions and am considerate of other people in
group settings as well as being an extremely open to new ideas.
</p>

<h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>

<p>The results of my tests indicate that while I am an emotionally driven person, I am at my most comfortable in group
settings when interacting with other people.In the context of a team environment, I often seek to act as a leader
and delegate people into roles to promote group efficiency and coordination as well as to provide emotional support
and to collate the ideas of other members. An area of improvement, as indicated by my results would be my
organisation and preparation skills as I am a turbulent and spontaneous personality type that prefers to not plan
every exact detail.
</p>

<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>

<p>When it comes to forming a team, I will be seeking members with a range of ideas that differ from my own, but that
are able to provide meaningful contributions to the project through dialogue. I would also ideally have one or
multiple team members that can provide a meaningful plan and timeline for the team and set milestones, as my
personal flaw is my lack of organisational ability despite my tendency to act as an emotional leader. My personal
role would be to stimulate collaboration among other members as well as to provide emotional support and to
prompt discussions.</p>
